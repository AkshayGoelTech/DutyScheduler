# DutyScheduler
Chrome Extension developed to schedule duty for Resident Advisors at Virginia Tech.

This extension is meant to be used with a filled out duty poll, where employees have indicated days when they are available. Based on that information, this plugin, will match 2 people for each day to be on duty.
